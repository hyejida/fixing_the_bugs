            Describe a test plan for conducting a usability test for ICBC.com. The goals of usability testing include establishing a baseline of user performance, establishing and validating user performance measures, and identifying potential design concerns to be addressed in order to improve the efficiency, productivity, and end-user satisfaction.

          Based on our research we developed the following list of archetypes
          who would use ICBC's website. By creating this list of archetypes, it
          helps us (the evaluators) to understand who our typical users are and
          develop a stronger emotional connection with the user. By knowing our
          users, we have a better idea of how they will interact with ICBC’s
          services, navigation and understand their goals and model a typical
          journey on the site.

              To ensure our participants fit our ideal user for ICBC based on

              any, with ICBC's website. These questions were a combination of
              multiple choice and written.

            users chose to use the global navigation over the card navigation.
            This is because card navigation depended on the user screen size. We
            put small six icons for the services that ICBC users look for
            frequently further up on the homepage. Using icons is good to
            present blocks of information visually and draw attention.
